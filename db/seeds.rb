# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# require 'open-uri'


# demo_user = User.create(username: "demo_user93", password: "password93")
# file = open('https://s3.amazonaws.com/instagraff-seeds/demouser.jpg')

# demo_user.profile_pic.attach(io: file, filename: 'demouser.jpg')
